// ======8kyu Do something"n.times"(Simplifying "for" loops) ======//

// However, I myself find the for loop very complex and unreadable. Think about it - would you know what the for loop does if you've never learned computer programming? For example, if you've never coded before, would you have any idea what this thing in the for loop: i = 0; i < number; i++ means?

// Therefore, I would like you to define a method callable on integers, Number.prototype.times, that effectively replaces the for loop. It should work like this:

Number.prototype.times = function (f) {
  for (let i = 0; i < this; i++) f(i)
}


// ======8kyu Be Concise II - I Need Squares ======//

// You are given a program squaresOnly that accepts an array of natural numbers up to and including 100 (and including 0) of length >= 1, array, and returns a new array containing only square numbers that have appeared in the input array.

// Refactor the solution to use as few characters as possible. There is a maximum character limit of 127. Here are a few hints:

// There are a lot of handy built-in Array methods in Javascript that you may have never heard of even after completing a basic course in Javascript (e.g. those provided by Codecademy) - well, at least I haven't heard of until quite recently. You may also want to research any new built-in methods offered by ES6, the newest specification of Javascript at the time of writing.
// Don't you think the array parameter is a bit wordy? ;)

function squaresOnly(array) {
  return array.filter(num=>Number.isInteger(Math.sqrt(num)))
}


// =======8kyu Be Concise III - Sum Squares =======//

// You are given a program sumSquares that takes an array as input and returns the sum of the squares of each item in an array. For example:

// sumSquares([1,2,3,4,5]) === 55 // 1 ** 2 + 2 ** 2 + 3 ** 2 + 4 ** 2 + 5 ** 2
// sumSquares([7,3,9,6,5]) === 200
// sumSquares([11,13,15,18,2]) === 843
// Shorten the code such that it meets the requirements.

// A few hints:

// Try researching about built-in Array methods; they may help shorten your code a lot

function sumSquares(array) {
  return array.reduce((a,b)=>a+b**2,0)
}

// ======8kyu SpeedCode #3 × Fun with ES6 Classes #5 - Dogs and Classes ======//


// Objective
// Preloaded for you is a class Dog:

// class Dog {
//   constructor(name, age, gender, species, size, master, loyal) {
//     this.name = name;
//     this.age = age;
//     this.gender = gender;
//     this.species = species;
//     this.legs = 4;
//     this.size = size;
//     this.master = master;
//     this.loyal = loyal;
//   }
// }
// You are then given a working class Labrador as your initial code.

// class Labrador {
//   constructor(name, age, gender, master) {
//     this.name = name;
//     this.age = age;
//     this.gender = gender;
//     this.species = "Labrador";
//     this.legs = 4;
//     this.size = "Large";
//     this.master = master;
//     this.loyal = true;
//   }
// }
// Shorten it so that it meets the strict character count requirements for this Kata.

// Quick, get your timer out and get ready to time yourself. Are you ready? Ready, get set, GO!!! :D


class Labrador extends Dog {
  constructor(name, age, gender, master) {
    super(name, age, gender, 'Labrador', 'Large', master, true)
  }
}
