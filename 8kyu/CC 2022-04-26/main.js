// ====== 8kyu Sum without highest and lowest number ======//

// Sum all the numbers of a given array ( cq. list ), except the highest and the lowest element ( by value, not by index! ).

// The highest or lowest element respectively is a single element at each edge, even if there are more than one with the same value.

// Mind the input validation.


sumArray = a => a ? a.sort((x, y) => x - y).slice(1, -1).reduce((s, e) => s + e, 0) : 0

//  ====== 8kyu Total amount of points ======//

// Our football team finished the championship. The result of each match look like "x:y". Results of all matches are recorded in the collection.

// For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]

// Write a function that takes such collection and counts the points of our team in the championship. Rules for counting points for each match:

// if x > y: 3 points
// if x < y: 0 point
// if x = y: 1 point
// Notes:

// there are 10 matches in the championship
// 0 <= x <= 4
// 0 <= y <= 4

function points(games) {
  let total = 0;
  games.map(game => {
    if (game[0] === game[2]) {
      total += 1;
    } else if (game[0] > game[2]) {
      total += 3;
    }
  });
