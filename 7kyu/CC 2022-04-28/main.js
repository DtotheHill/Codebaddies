// ====== 7kyu Square Every Digit ======//

// Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

// For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.

// Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer

function squareDigits(num){
  return +num.toString().split('').map(el=> el * el).join('')
}

// ======= 7kyu You're a square =======//

// A square of squares
// You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

// However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

// Task
// Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

// In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

// The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

let isSquare = function(n){
  return Math.sqrt(n) % 1 ===0
